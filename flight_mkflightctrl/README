Put all hardware specific software and executables for the MikroKopter FlightCtrl
board here.

Since there are still some parts of the MikroKopter in use, put them here too.

Applying this patch implements a protocol to control the MikroKopter through the second serial port of the AVR.

1. Checkout the MikroKopter FlightCtrl sources from the SVN repository as described in their wiki: http://www.mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/MikroKopterRepository

2. Copy all the files to the *_patch directory.

3. Now, patch the makefile: patch < makefile.patch

4. Make it!
